# Texture_Generators
Repository to generate 2D textures in a variety of approaches and add some texture characterization measures

Code structure : 
We are designing a package with separate classes for image generation, plotting, and saving. The solution will use a base class structure with clear separation of concerns.

Package Structure:
1. BaseGenerator: Abstract base class for 2D image generation

2. ImagePlotter: Handles visualization of 2D images

3. DataSaver: Handles multi-format export with metadata persistence
